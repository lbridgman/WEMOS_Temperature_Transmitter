# WEMOS Temperature Transmitter
_Schematics and code to build a wireless temperature transmitter using an Arduino-based microcontroller._

There are tons of similar projects out there on GitHub, but I found that none directly addressed my particular needs based on my specific microcontroller chipset and the manner in which I wanted to receive the temperature output.

## 1. Use Case
**As an aspiring gardener, I would like to be able to monitor a room's temperature on my phone without having to displace myself.**
I built this project to monitor the relative temperature around the wildflower seedlings I grow in my cold room during the early spring months.  The cold room isn't heated, but should be warm enough relative to our harsh Canadian springs which can often float around 0Â°C.
